<p><strong>What is E-Waste?</strong><br></p>
<p align="justify">E-waste is loosely defined as electronic products that are at or near the end of their useful life.  This can include cellphones, microwaves, cables and computer accessories, printers, and other household or office appliances that contain electronic components.</p> 
<p align="justify">E-waste items often contain hazardous or valuable materials, or both.   Hazardous materials can negatively impact the groundwater and environment for humans and other animals when not disposed properly.  Valuable materials can be reused, resold, or recycled into new electronic goods as an alternative to extracting or producing more of these materials.</p>
<p><strong>How should it be processed?</strong><br></p>
<p align="justify">E-waste processing can include the collection, classification, and processing of the various materials found in disposed electronic devices to reduce both the environmental and financial costs of the production of electronic goods.</p>

<p align="justify">Currently, only an estimated 15-18% of electronic waste is recycled and the remainder ends up in landfills.  A large portion of the improperly disposed e-waste is generated by individual consumers who are unaware of the proper disposal methods. But hopefully, this website can help people out!</p>
